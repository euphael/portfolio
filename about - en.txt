Hello, I'm Raphael Marques, 21 years old, and currently a Software Engineering student at PUC Minas, where I'm in my 4th semester. I started my programming journey at COTEMIG Technical School between 2020 and 2022, learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and PHP with MySQL. It was there that I had my first experience with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#, and I developed simple projects involving databases. During this time, I also participated in the COTEMIG START-UP initiative, where we collaborated to develop a party organization platform with live deployment.

Currently, in my Software Engineering program at PUC Minas, I am deepening my knowledge in various areas such as Java, modular programming, algorithms, data structures (like stacks and lists), and code quality. I have also explored topics related to operating systems and computer networks, studying the different layers of networking, such as the link, physical, and transport layers. One of the most significant projects I worked on was Gamer Sync, a social network for gamers, where I worked in a team using the SCRUM agile methodology.

I have two years of practical experience in the development field, having worked at companies like Planetfone, where I served as a developer on challenging projects, and Buffet CÃ©lia Soutto, where I contributed to application development and technical support, enhancing my skills in both backend development and user support.

In addition to my technical skills, I have continuously worked on developing essential soft skills such as teamwork, effective communication, proactivity, and adaptability to new challenges. All of my projects are available on my GitHub, where I share my learning and the results of my practices and studies. I am a determined professional with a strong desire to learn, always seeking new challenges to expand my knowledge and stand out in the Software Engineering field.
