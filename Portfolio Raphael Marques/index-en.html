                Hello, I'm <strong>Raphael Marques</strong>, 21 years old and currently a <em>Software Engineering</em> student at PUC Minas, 
                where I'm in my 4th semester. I have 2 years of practical experience in development and over 3 years of continuous study in programming. Here's a summary of my professional and academic journey:
                <br><br>
                I started my programming journey at COTEMIG Technical School, where I learned the basics of <strong>HTML, CSS, and PHP with MySQL</strong>.
                I developed simple projects, including databases and object-oriented programming (OOP) with C#.
                I participated in COTEMIG START-UP, where we worked on developing a party organization platform with live deployment.
                <br>
                <strong>PUC Minas (currently in the 4th semester):</strong>
                In my Software Engineering course (rated 5 by MEC), I deepened my knowledge in <em>Java, modular programming, OOP, algorithms, data structures (stacks, lists), and code quality</em>.
                I also studied operating systems and computer networks, exploring the link, physical, transport layers, etc.
                One of the most significant projects I worked on was <strong>Gamer Sync</strong>, a social network for gamers, where I worked in a team using SCRUM.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Professional Experience</strong>
                <br>
                <strong>Planetfone:</strong>
                I worked as a developer, applying advanced programming techniques in projects to streamline company management.
                <br>
                <strong>Buffet C√©lia Soutto:</strong>
                I worked on application development and technical support, improving my skills in back-end, front-end, and soft skills.
                <br><br>
                Throughout my journey, I have continuously worked on improving my technical skills and soft skills, such as:
                <strong>Teamwork, Effective Communication, Proactivity, Adapting to New Challenges</strong>,
                GitHub. All of my projects are available on my <a href="https://github.com/euphael" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none !important; color: #6E21C5 !important;">GitHub</a>, where I share my learning and the results of my practices and studies.
                I am a determined professional, with a strong desire to learn and grow. I always seek new challenges to expand my knowledge and stand out in the technology field.
